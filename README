This engine is now capable of human play with data recording.
Data recording is a comma delimited list of the board state, which are the values of the squares (for y, for x), followed by the direction of choice given the board state.

"Plugin capabilities for NN training and testing"
Somehow I need to make this work with a python program running at the same time. So maybe I have my python script run this exe in a shell, and the python script can run commands in the shell? And somehow I need to send the boardstate into the python program.....will need to research how to do this, there may be a better way.
